# Dear IGN, 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the Village of Jubilife City?
Step 1: One of my favorite aspects of playing videogames has always been discovering the harder to find lore in a game so that is exactly what I will do to help me answer this question. My refined googling skills from coding came in handy when searching for a greater understanding of how Voltorb functions and I was able to quickly find a thread from the user “coconutarmy1” on how much electricity Voltorb can produce an hour. In this thread the user was able to estimate that an average Electrode can produce about 2.3 billion killowats per hour. 

Step 2: Now that we know how much energy the second evolution of Voltorb can produce, we can use a ratio based on size and weight to determine how much energy a Voltorb can produce. According to the document on IGN, a Voltorb is 1’08” tall and weights 22.8lbs. We can compare this to an Electrode which is 3’11” and weighs 147 lbs. After averaging the proportions I concluded that a Electrode can be compared on a 1:4.4 ratio to Voltorb. In this case we can conclude that a Voltorb should generate on average 522,727,000 (522 million) killowats per hour.

Step 3: The next step I would take to solve this answer is comparing Jubilife City’s power to a real city’s power usage. The Sinnoh region is where Pokémon Diamond and Pearl take place in and many players say that this region is based of the northernmost island of Japan, Hokkaidō. Jublife City is much like Sapparo. Hokkaido’s largest urban center, TV tower and all. Japan averages around 7,458 killowats per hour of energy per person, so taking in mind the population of 1.95 million in Sapporo, it would take 14,543,100,000 (14 billion) killowats per hour to power up the city of Saparro. 

Step 4: Now that we have the average amount of electricity a Voltorb can produce (522 million) and the average amount of electricity it takes to power a city similar to Jubilife city (14 billion) we can answer the question. It would take 28 Voltorbs to power the Jubilife city. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
